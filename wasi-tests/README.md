## WASI tests

The testsuite is still in development and in its early stages. The testsuite is built upon [wasmtime's wasi-tests](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/03077e0de9bc5bb92623d58a1e5d78b828fd1634/crates/test-programs/wasi-tests) as a starting point. The code strutcure, testing approach and some helper functions are based on wasmtime's tests.
